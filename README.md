# Amazon Clone

Welcome to my Amazon.com clone project! This is my first website created using HTML and CSS. The goal of this project was to replicate the look and feel of Amazon's homepage.

## Live Demo

Check out the live demo [here](https://subhajitdolai.github.io/Amazon-Clone/).

## Features

- **Homepage Layout**: A close replica of Amazon's homepage.
- **Navigation Bar**: A fully functional navigation bar.
- **Product Listings**: Sample products with images, titles, and prices.
- **Footer**: A footer similar to Amazon's.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the website.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout.

## Limitations

- **Responsiveness**: Not yet responsive for smaller devices. Future updates will address this.

## Future Improvements

- **Responsive Design**: Use media queries for various screen sizes.
- **JavaScript**: Add interactivity and dynamic content.
- **Backend Integration**: Fetch real product data from a backend service.
